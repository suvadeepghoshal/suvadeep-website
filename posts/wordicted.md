# Wordle Clone

**A bit different from the traditional WORDLE** that is out in the internet

## Features

- Guess the WORDLE WORD in six tries
- After each try the color of the letter will change to show how close your guess was to the word
- _Rules_
  - Each word has to be a valid five letter english word
  - If the letter is present in the WORDLE and postion of the letter is not correct then letter will turn **YELLOW**
  - If the letter and the position of the letter matches with that of the WORDLE then the letter will turn **GREEN**
  - If the letter is not present in the WORDLE then it will remain without colour
- _Twist_
  - This game will ask you your mood at the beginning.
  - It can be any thought that is there currrently on your mind. You can say a word or a small sentence, but keep it short and crisp
  - The game will match your personality/mood and generate the Wordle word for you.
  - Then you can start solving it in the traditional way.
  - If you **WIN**, then you can view everything about the word, much like a _dictionary_

## Tech Stack

- Java - JDK 16
- API calls for the words and the dictionary
- VsCode (editor)
